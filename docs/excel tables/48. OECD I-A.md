# OECD I-A

First operation in the leontief method, which calculates the complementary share of the industry matrix.

The identity matrix `I` is to matricial operations
the same as the more commonly understood identity `1`

`x = 1 - a` is equivalent to `X = I - A`

In our particular scenario `a` are values normalised (from 0 to 1),
so `x` represents the difference to 1; where `a` has `0.6`, then `x` has `0.4`.

In the leontief method `(I - A)` is used to divide the demand `B / (I - A)`
providing the change needed in `A` to match demand `B`
