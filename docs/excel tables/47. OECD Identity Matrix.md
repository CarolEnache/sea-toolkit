# OECD Identity Matrix

This is just an identity matrix of the same size of the industry matrix.
It is relevant for the leontief calculation.

An identity matrix has all elements 0 and diagonal 1, like:

1  0  0  0
0  1  0  0
0  0  1  0
0  0  0  1

This in JS becomes trivial `const I = identity(A.size());`
