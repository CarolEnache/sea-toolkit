# Data

The data was originally provided as a collection of excel files with macros.

This was transformed into CSV, manipulated and standardised into a column format, then transformed into parquet.

There's a naive implementation in server/approach/data-to-report/data/parquet

## Parquet

Parquet is a popular open-source columnar data format that is widely used in big data and data engineering workflows. Compared to traditional row-oriented data formats like CSV, Parquet offers several advantages:

- **Column-Oriented Storage**: Parquet stores data in a column-oriented fashion, which means that values for each column are stored together. This allows for efficient querying and processing of specific columns, rather than having to read the entire row.

- **Compression and Encoding**: Parquet uses advanced compression and encoding techniques to reduce the storage footprint of data. This can lead to significant storage savings, especially for large datasets.

- **Partitioning**: Parquet supports partitioning data by one or more columns, which can further improve query performance by allowing the system to quickly skip over irrelevant partitions.

- **Schema Evolution**: Parquet's schema is self-describing, which means that the structure of the data is stored alongside the data itself. This enables schema evolution, where the schema can be modified over time without breaking existing data.

Parquet's tables are stored as independent files, which allows us to work in a more modular way, there's not a "central database" nor permissions or auth. This can be scaled/delegated to an S3 bucket.

## DuckDB

DuckDB is an embedded, serverless, SQL-based OLAP database engine that is particularly well-suited for working with Parquet files. Some key features of DuckDB include:

- **Fast and Efficient**: DuckDB is designed to be fast and efficient, leveraging columnar storage and modern CPU features to provide high-performance data processing.

- **Serverless**: DuckDB is an embedded database, meaning it can be easily integrated into your application without the need for a separate server process.

- **SQL-based**: DuckDB provides a familiar SQL interface, allowing you to query and analyze your data using standard SQL syntax.

- **Parquet Support**: DuckDB has built-in support for reading and writing Parquet files, making it easy to work with this popular data format.
