# Methodology Summary

Our jorney starts by aggregating data from multiple sources. Some of these sources are public data, and therefore we can disclose the provider; while other sources are private datasets that will limit how much can we share.

The data has to be scrutinized for completeness, accuracy, duplication; and refined into a consumable standard that we can compare year on year and for the years to come.
