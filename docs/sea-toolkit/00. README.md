# SEA Toolkit documentation

The aim of the sibling files (chapters) is to produce a scientific description of the methodology.

We will certainly lack the language to explain certain things. We can use blockquotes as if they were private comments.

If we were to provide information about the methodology followed to compile the report, widgets or other derivated work; it will be produced from these files.
