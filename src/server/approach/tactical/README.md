Here the code related to
bridging between data-to-report and report-to-data

There may be a moment where I can't continue exploring further the intricate paths in the excel.

Part of the effort will live in SQL then Typescript (in data-to-report),
...this approach expects to return to excel here...
Then continue in Typescript (in report-to-data)

Slowly, the typescript world will be eating out this approach until it can be deleted.
Slowly too, the SQL world will be eating out the typescript code to make it more performant.
