# ADGIMP: A Data Operations Framework

**ADGIMP** stands for **Add, Delete, Get, Integrate, Modify, Pivot**, representing a comprehensive and alphabetically ordered set of operations for managing and analyzing data. This framework offers clarity and structure, making it ideal for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- **ADD**: Insert records into the dataset.
- **DEL**: Delete records from the dataset.
- **GET**: Select existing records.
- **INT**: Integrate multiple sources.
- **MOD**: Update existing records.
- **PIV**: Aggregate existing records.

**ADGIMP** differs from the traditional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model by offering a more detailed and alphabetically ordered approach, enhancing readability and organization, especially in documentation and file systems. This structure is particularly useful in environments where clarity and precision are paramount.
